# Housing Prices in Stockholm: Inferential Statistics & Multivariate Regression

This repository contains an analysis of housing prices in Stockholm using **inferential statistics** and **multivariate regression modeling**. The study focuses on understanding how housing features such as **region, type, balcony, number of rooms, and area** influence the starting price of properties.  

## Project Highlights
- **Hypothesis Testing:** One-proportion z-tests and one-sample t-tests were used to test assumptions about the proportion of housing units with balconies and the mean housing area.
- **Confidence Intervals:** 90% and 95% confidence intervals were computed for proportions (apartment types) and numerical variables (rooms, area).
- **Regression Modeling:** Multivariate linear regression models, including log-transformations and interaction terms, were fitted to predict housing prices.
- **Model Diagnostics:** Residual analysis, homoscedasticity, and normality checks were performed to validate regression assumptions.
- **Predictions:** The model was used to predict starting prices for new housing units with 95% prediction intervals.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Language:** R  
- **Packages:** `readxl`, `stats`  

This repository provides a practical demonstration of applying **statistical inference**, **confidence intervals**, and **regression modeling** in a real-world housing market dataset.
